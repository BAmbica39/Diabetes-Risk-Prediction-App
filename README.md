Diabetes Risk Prediction App

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on health-related inputs using a trained ML model. The application is deployed using **Gradio** and runs fully in-browser.

Features
- User-friendly UI built with **Gradio**
- Predicts diabetes risk based on medical input
- Built using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- Allows **flagging** of unexpected results for review
- End-to-end pipeline: Data Cleaning → Model Training → Deployment

Tech Stack
- Python 
- Scikit-learn (for ML)
- Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)
- Gradio (for the UI)
- Joblib (model saving/loading)
